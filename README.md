# OC Image Manager
Images management and bank with NodeJS / Mongo DB. Will be able for using with any cms/platform/programming language.

Work in progress :)

Project Includes
- Image Bank with full text search
- Add images, with crop, resize, rotate, invert and metadata.
- CDNs / AWS S3 support

Basically, you will install it on a server and use a javascript to call a popup containing the manager. When some image is selected, the javascript will receive a callback with all image infos for using as you wish :)
